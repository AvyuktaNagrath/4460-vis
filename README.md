# Visualizing Economic Reality Through Market Data

This project is an interactive, multi-frame data story exploring how global economic events shape market performance over time. 
It uses a scroll-driven narrative that automatically transitions the viewer between sections. 
Any interactive features within each visualization are clearly indicated on-screen. 
The website guides the user through multiple perspectives, including long-term trends, crisis periods, sector relationships, and an exploratory view for deeper investigation.
